                        With over thirteen years of experience in adapting and blending File Harmonizer tools within various phases of leading industry methodologies from blue print to deployment of small to large scale systems, we realize that when using a global approach tomanage and reuse objects (i.e. build scripts,code, component documents, designs, functional specifications, global templates, installation scripts,plans, requirements,technical specifications, test cases, user manuals, etc.) a reduction in cost could be realized. Especially, when considering each object as a "document", File Harmonizer providesan adaptable structure which allows our tools to perform the appropriate processing required to maximize the reuse of documents.

                        Reusing Objects is an efficient and smart alternative to creating objects from scratch manually from idea to print. Creating objects from persisting objects boost creation efficiency by more than 20%; the efficiency percent increases as the amount of reusable content increases.
